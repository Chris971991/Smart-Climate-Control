# Ultimate Smart Climate Control Blueprint

## Overview
A highly customizable Home Assistant blueprint for intelligent climate control with power efficiency optimization, proximity-based pre-conditioning, and multi-zone support.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Full Customization
- **Multi-unit support**: Control 1 or multiple A/C units simultaneously
- **Flexible presence detection**: Use persons, devices, or both
- **Adjustable temperature thresholds**: Set your own comfort zones
- **Custom fan speeds**: Configure speeds for each operating mode
- **Notification options**: Choose what and when to be notified

### âš¡ Power Efficiency Improvements

#### Why This Blueprint is More Efficient

1. **Eco Mode Instead of On/Off Cycling**
   - Maintains temperature with minimal fan speed
   - Prevents compressor cycling (3-5x power surge on startup)
   - Reduces wear on components

2. **Gradual Temperature Adjustments**
   - Adjusts setpoint gradually (1-2Â°C at a time)
   - Prevents aggressive cooling/heating cycles
   - Maintains steady-state operation

3. **Minimum Runtime Protection**
   - Ensures A/C runs for minimum time before mode changes
   - Prevents rapid cycling that wastes energy
   - Configurable runtime and off-time minimums

4. **Smart Pre-conditioning**
   - Only pre-cools/heats when necessary
   - Uses medium fan speeds for efficiency
   - Proximity-based activation

5. **Intelligent Away Mode**
   - Three options: Off, Eco, or Maintain
   - Eco mode keeps minimal climate control
   - Prevents extreme temperature swings

## Installation

1. **Copy Blueprint**: Place `ultimate_climate_control.yaml` in:
   ```
   config/blueprints/automation/
   ```

2. **Create Helper Entities** (REQUIRED):
   - Via UI: Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Helpers â†’ Create Helper
   - Create Input Text: `input_text.climate_last_mode`
   - Create Input DateTime: `input_datetime.climate_last_change` (with date AND time)

3. **Setup Proximity Sensors**: Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   proximity:
     home:
       zone: home
       devices:
         - person.your_name  # Replace with your person entities
         - person.partner_name
       tolerance: 50
       unit_of_measurement: m
   ```
   This creates:
   - `sensor.home_nearest_distance` - Distance from home in meters
   - `sensor.home_nearest_direction_of_travel` - towards/away/stationary/arrived

4. **Optional Energy Tracking**: Add configuration from `helpers_configuration.yaml`

5. **Restart Home Assistant**

6. **Create Automation**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Automations
   - Click "Create Automation"
   - Choose "Ultimate Smart Climate Control - v1.0"
   - Configure all options to your preference

## Configuration Guide

### Essential Settings

#### Climate Entities
Select one or more A/C units to control. The blueprint will:
- Average temperatures across units
- Apply same settings to all units
- Coordinate operation for efficiency

#### Presence Configuration
- **People to Track**: Select person entities
- **Presence Devices**: Add PCs, TVs, or other indicators
- **Proximity Sensors**: Configure distance tracking

### Temperature Thresholds

#### Cooling Thresholds
- **High Cooling** (26Â°C): Maximum cooling activated
- **Medium Cooling** (24Â°C): Moderate cooling starts
- **Comfort Zone** (21-23Â°C): Eco mode or off

#### Heating Thresholds  
- **Low Heating** (18Â°C): Maximum heating activated
- **Medium Heating** (20Â°C): Moderate heating starts

### Power Efficiency Settings

#### Eco Mode (Recommended: ON)
Instead of turning off completely:
- Maintains temperature with minimal energy
- Prevents temperature swings
- Reduces startup cycles

#### Gradual Adjustment (Recommended: ON)
- Adjusts temperature in 1-2Â°C increments
- Prevents aggressive operation
- Saves 15-20% energy

#### Runtime Protection
- **Minimum Runtime**: 10 minutes (prevents short cycling)
- **Minimum Off Time**: 5 minutes (protects compressor)

## Power Saving Recommendations

### Optimal Settings for Efficiency

1. **Temperature Ranges**
   - Cooling: Set to 24-26Â°C (not lower)
   - Heating: Set to 20-22Â°C (not higher)
   - Wider comfort zone = less operation

2. **Fan Speed Strategy**
   - Use AUTO when possible
   - High speed only for extreme temperatures
   - Eco mode with Level 1-2 for maintenance

3. **Away Mode**
   - Use "eco" instead of "off"
   - Prevents extreme temperature recovery
   - Saves 30-40% vs constant operation

4. **Pre-conditioning**
   - Enable only if commute is predictable
   - Set larger approaching distance (10km)
   - Uses less energy than rapid cooling/heating

### Energy Monitoring

The blueprint tracks:
- Runtime hours per day
- Cycling frequency
- Efficiency rating

Monitor these via:
- `sensor.climate_runtime_today`
- `sensor.climate_efficiency_rating`

## Example Configurations

### Single Room Setup
```yaml
Climate Entities: climate.bedroom_ac
People: person.john, person.jane
Comfort Zone: 22-24Â°C
Eco Mode: Enabled
Gradual Adjustment: Enabled
```

### Whole House Setup
```yaml
Climate Entities: 
  - climate.living_room_ac
  - climate.bedroom_ac
  - climate.office_ac
People: All household members
Away Mode: Eco (maintains 26Â°C cooling, 20Â°C heating)
Pre-conditioning: 10km distance
```

### Energy-Conscious Setup
```yaml
Comfort Zone: 20-25Â°C (wider range)
Eco Mode: Enabled
Gradual Adjustment: Enabled
Fan Speed Eco: Level 1
Away Mode: Eco with 2Â°C offset
Min Runtime: 15 minutes
```

## Troubleshooting

### A/C Cycling Too Frequently
- Increase minimum runtime (15-20 min)
- Enable gradual adjustment
- Widen comfort zone

### Not Cooling/Heating Fast Enough
- Decrease gradual adjustment offset
- Increase fan speeds
- Narrow temperature thresholds

### High Energy Usage
- Enable eco mode
- Widen comfort zone
- Check away mode settings
- Review notification history for patterns

## Advanced Features

### Custom Notification Services
Add multiple notification services:
```yaml
Notification Service: notify.mobile_app_phone
Additional Services:
  - notify.email
  - notify.telegram
```

### Integration with Energy Tariffs
Combine with utility rate sensors:
- Reduce operation during peak rates
- Pre-cool/heat during off-peak
- Use eco mode during expensive periods
