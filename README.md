### üìù Room Naming Guide

#### Why Room Names Matter:
- **Debug Logs**: All log entries are prefixed with your room name for easy identification
- **BLE Detection**: Must match your BLE sensor output EXACTLY for presence detection
- **Multi-Room Setup**: Distinguishes between different automation instances

#### Naming Rules:
```yaml
‚úÖ GOOD Examples:
- "Living Room" ‚Üí [room_name] = living_room
- "Master Bedroom" ‚Üí [room_name] = master_bedroom  
- "Office" ‚Üí [room_name] = office
- "Kids Room" ‚Üí [room_name] = kids_room

‚ùå AVOID:
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()
- Numbers only: "Room1", "Room2" 
- Very long names (keep under 20 characters)
```

#### Helper Entity Naming Convention:
```
input_[type].climate_[function]_[room_name]

Examples:
Room: "Living Room" ‚Üí [room_name] = living_room
Room: "Master Bedroom" ‚Üí [room_name] = master_bedroom
Room: "Home Office" ‚Üí [room_name] = home_office

Final Entity IDs:
- input_text.climate_last_mode_living_room
- input_text.climate_last_mode_master_bedroom  
- input_text.climate_last_mode_home_office
```

#### BLE Sensor Matching:
If using BLE presence detection, check your sensor state in Developer Tools:
```yaml
# Example: If your BLE sensor reports "Living Room"
Room Name in Blueprint: "Living Room" (exact match required)
[room_name] = living_room
Helper entities: input_text.climate_last_mode_living_room

# Example: If your BLE sensor reports "office"  
Room Name in Blueprint: "office" (exact match required)
[room_name] = office
Helper entities: input_text.climate_last_mode_office
```

### Step 3: Proximity Sensors (Optional)
Add to your `configuration.yaml` for proximity-based features:
```yaml
proximity:
  home:
    zone: home
    devices:
      - person.your_name
      - person.partner_name
    tolerance: 50
    unit_of_measurement: m
```

This creates:
- `sensor.home_nearest_distance` (distance in meters)
- `sensor.home_nearest_direction_of_travel` (towards/away/stationary/arrived)

### Step 4: Weather Integration (Optional)
Ensure you have a weather integration configured:
- Default: `weather.home` or `weather.forecast_home`
- Or configure a dedicated outdoor temperature sensor

### Step 5: Create Automation
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes
2. Click "Create Automation" ‚Üí "Use Blueprint"
3. Select "Ultimate Smart Climate Control - v2.22.5"
4. Configure all settings according to your preferences
5. **Important**: Test with debug logging enabled initially

### Step 6: Configuration Tips
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic Auto mode, add advanced features gradually
2. **Enable Debug Logging**: Initially enable for troubleshooting (disable after setup)
3. **Test Temperature Thresholds**: Verify all 6 thresholds work correctly
4. **Validate Presence Detection**: Ensure room sensors work as expected
5. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Check system logs for performance insights

## Version History

### **v3.0.4** (Current) - Critical Smart Mode Timeout Fix

**üêõ CRITICAL FIX: PRESENCE TIMEOUT GRACE PERIOD**
- **‚úÖ FIXED TIMEOUT LOGIC** - Smart mode now checks control mode BEFORE presence timeout
- **üö™ IMMEDIATE SHUTOFF** - AC exits immediately when `room_presence_detected` becomes false
- **‚è±Ô∏è NO GRACE PERIOD IN SMART MODE** - Presence timeout only applies to Auto mode (as intended)
- **üîß PROPER LOGIC ORDER** - `smart_presence_active` returns `room_presence_detected` directly for Smart mode
- **üìä REAL-WORLD IMPACT** - AC no longer continues running for 5+ minutes after leaving room
- **‚úÖ BACKWARD COMPATIBLE** - Auto mode still has presence timeout grace period, Manual mode unchanged

### **v3.0.3** - Critical Smart Mode Continue Fix

**üêõ CRITICAL FIX: SMART MODE HYSTERESIS**
- **‚úÖ FIXED CONTINUE CONDITION** - Smart mode now respects presence during "continue until target" phase
- **üö™ IMMEDIATE SHUTOFF** - AC turns off when presence is lost, even during active cooling/heating cycles
- **üéØ ALL 6 MODES FIXED** - Added presence check to LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH heating & cooling continue conditions
- **üîß PROPER LOGIC** - `control_mode == 'Smart' and not smart_presence_active` returns False to exit cycle
- **üìä REAL-WORLD IMPACT** - Master Bedroom AC no longer runs when room is empty just because house presence is detected
- **‚úÖ BACKWARD COMPATIBLE** - Auto and Manual modes unchanged, only Smart mode behavior improved

### **v3.0.2** - Smart Mode Presence Detection Fix
- **üêõ FIXED** - Smart mode no longer activates AC when user is in different room (e.g., AC in Master Bedroom when user in Office)
- **‚úÖ ROOM-LEVEL PRESENCE** - Smart mode now only activates based on room presence detection
- **üè† HOUSE-LEVEL PRESERVED** - Auto mode still uses house presence for whole-home automation
- **üîß LOGIC UPDATE** - Added control mode check before house presence check in `smart_presence_active` variable

### **v3.0.1** - Packages Configuration Auto-Add Fix
- **üîß FIXED** - Packages configuration now properly added to configuration.yaml automatically

### **v2.22.14** - Critical Auto-Off & Fan Speed Display Fixes
- **üéØ AUTO-OFF TARGET FIX** - AC now properly cools to 22¬∞C instead of stopping early at 23.8¬∞C due to wrong target temperature
- **üìä DISTANCE CALCULATION FIX** - Shows actual distance (1.8¬∞C) instead of incorrect 0.0¬∞C when system mode is "off"
- **‚ö° FAN SPEED DISPLAY FIX** - Debug messages show actual fan speeds ("Silence", "3", "5") instead of confusing "Auto" labels
- **üõ†Ô∏è TEMPLATE ERROR FIX** - Resolved UndefinedError preventing automation execution due to variable scope issues
- **üîß VARIABLE SCOPE FIX** - Proper dependency order ensures all escalation/de-escalation features work correctly
