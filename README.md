# Ultimate Smart Climate Control Blueprint

## Overview
A highly customizable Home Assistant blueprint for intelligent climate control with power efficiency optimization, proximity-based pre-conditioning, and multi-zone support.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Full Customization
- **Multi-unit support**: Control 1 or multiple A/C units simultaneously
- **Flexible presence detection**: Use persons, devices, or both
- **Adjustable temperature thresholds**: Set your own comfort zones
- **Custom fan speeds**: Configure speeds for each operating mode
- **Notification options**: Choose what and when to be notified

### ⚡ Power Efficiency Improvements

#### Why This Blueprint is More Efficient

1. **Eco Mode Instead of On/Off Cycling**
   - Maintains temperature with minimal fan speed
   - Prevents compressor cycling (3-5x power surge on startup)
   - Reduces wear on components

2. **Gradual Temperature Adjustments**
   - Adjusts setpoint gradually (1-2°C at a time)
   - Prevents aggressive cooling/heating cycles
   - Maintains steady-state operation

3. **Minimum Runtime Protection**
   - Ensures A/C runs for minimum time before mode changes
   - Prevents rapid cycling that wastes energy
   - Configurable runtime and off-time minimums

4. **Smart Pre-conditioning**
   - Only pre-cools/heats when necessary
   - Uses medium fan speeds for efficiency
   - Proximity-based activation

5. **Intelligent Away Mode**
   - Three options: Off, Eco, or Maintain
   - Eco mode keeps minimal climate control
   - Prevents extreme temperature swings

## Installation

1. **Copy Blueprint**: Place `ultimate_climate_control.yaml` in:
   ```
   config/blueprints/automation/
   ```

2. **Create Helper Entities** (REQUIRED - unique for each room):
   - Via UI: Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper
   - For Living Room:
     - Input Text: `input_text.climate_last_mode_living_room`
     - Input DateTime: `input_datetime.climate_last_change_living_room` (with date AND time)
   - For Bedroom:
     - Input Text: `input_text.climate_last_mode_bedroom`
     - Input DateTime: `input_datetime.climate_last_change_bedroom` (with date AND time)
   - Name them uniquely for each room/zone you're controlling

3. **Setup Proximity Sensors**: Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   proximity:
     home:
       zone: home
       devices:
         - person.your_name  # Replace with your person entities
         - person.partner_name
       tolerance: 50
       unit_of_measurement: m
   ```
   This creates:
   - `sensor.home_nearest_distance` - Distance from home in meters
   - `sensor.home_nearest_direction_of_travel` - towards/away/stationary/arrived

4. **Optional Energy Tracking**: Add configuration from `helpers_configuration.yaml`

5. **Restart Home Assistant**

6. **Create Automation**:
   - Go to Settings → Automations
   - Click "Create Automation"
   - Choose "Ultimate Smart Climate Control - v1.0"
   - Configure all options to your preference

## Configuration Guide

### Essential Settings

#### Climate Entities
Select one or more A/C units to control. The blueprint will:
- Average temperatures across units
- Apply same settings to all units
- Coordinate operation for efficiency

#### Presence Configuration
- **People to Track**: Select person entities
- **Presence Devices**: Add PCs, TVs, or other indicators
- **Proximity Sensors**: Configure distance tracking

### Temperature Thresholds

#### Cooling Thresholds
- **High Cooling** (26°C): Maximum cooling activated
- **Medium Cooling** (24°C): Moderate cooling starts
- **Comfort Zone** (21-23°C): Eco mode or off

#### Heating Thresholds  
- **Low Heating** (18°C): Maximum heating activated
- **Medium Heating** (20°C): Moderate heating starts

### Power Efficiency Settings

#### Eco Mode (Recommended: ON)
Instead of turning off completely:
- Maintains temperature with minimal energy
- Prevents temperature swings
- Reduces startup cycles

#### Gradual Adjustment (Recommended: ON)
- Adjusts temperature in 1-2°C increments
- Prevents aggressive operation
- Saves 15-20% energy

#### Runtime Protection
- **Minimum Runtime**: 10 minutes (prevents short cycling)
- **Minimum Off Time**: 5 minutes (protects compressor)

## Power Saving Recommendations

### Optimal Settings for Efficiency

1. **Temperature Ranges**
   - Cooling: Set to 24-26°C (not lower)
   - Heating: Set to 20-22°C (not higher)
   - Wider comfort zone = less operation

2. **Fan Speed Strategy**
   - Use AUTO when possible
   - High speed only for extreme temperatures
   - Eco mode with Level 1-2 for maintenance

3. **Away Mode**
   - Use "eco" instead of "off"
   - Prevents extreme temperature recovery
   - Saves 30-40% vs constant operation

4. **Pre-conditioning**
   - Enable only if commute is predictable
   - Set larger approaching distance (10km)
   - Uses less energy than rapid cooling/heating

### Energy Monitoring

The blueprint tracks:
- Runtime hours per day
- Cycling frequency
- Efficiency rating

Monitor these via:
- `sensor.climate_runtime_today`
- `sensor.climate_efficiency_rating`

## Example Configurations

### Single Room Setup
```yaml
Climate Entities: climate.bedroom_ac
People: person.john, person.jane
Comfort Zone: 22-24°C
Eco Mode: Enabled
Gradual Adjustment: Enabled
```

### Whole House Setup
```yaml
Climate Entities: 
  - climate.living_room_ac
  - climate.bedroom_ac
  - climate.office_ac
People: All household members
Away Mode: Eco (maintains 26°C cooling, 20°C heating)
Pre-conditioning: 10km distance
```

### Energy-Conscious Setup
```yaml
Comfort Zone: 20-25°C (wider range)
Eco Mode: Enabled
Gradual Adjustment: Enabled
Fan Speed Eco: Level 1
Away Mode: Eco with 2°C offset
Min Runtime: 15 minutes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging
1. **Turn on debug mode** in the blueprint settings
2. **View logs**: Settings → System → Logs
3. **Filter by**: `blueprints.climate_control`
4. **Look for**: 🔍 CLIMATE DEBUG messages

Debug logs show:
- Trigger events and reasons
- Current temperature and thresholds
- Decision logic (which mode activated)
- Why no action was taken
- All condition evaluations

### A/C Cycling Too Frequently
- Increase minimum runtime (15-20 min)
- Enable gradual adjustment
- Widen comfort zone
- Check debug logs for rapid mode changes

### Not Cooling/Heating Fast Enough
- Decrease gradual adjustment offset
- Increase fan speeds
- Narrow temperature thresholds
- Check debug logs to see if conditions are being met

### High Energy Usage
- Enable eco mode
- Widen comfort zone
- Check away mode settings
- Review debug logs for cycling patterns

### Automation Not Triggering
1. Enable debug logging
2. Check "Last triggered" in automations list
3. Verify helper entities exist and are named correctly
4. Ensure someone is "home" in the system
5. Check temperature sensor is providing valid readings

## Advanced Features

### Custom Notification Services
Add multiple notification services:
```yaml
Notification Service: notify.mobile_app_phone
Additional Services:
  - notify.email
  - notify.telegram
```

### Integration with Energy Tariffs
Combine with utility rate sensors:
- Reduce operation during peak rates
- Pre-cool/heat during off-peak
- Use eco mode during expensive periods
