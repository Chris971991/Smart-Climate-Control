### ‚ö° Power Efficiency Improvements

#### Why This Blueprint is More Efficient

1. **Eco Mode Instead of On/Off Cycling**
   - Maintains temperature with minimal fan speed
   - Prevents compressor cycling (3-5x power surge on startup)
   - Reduces wear on components

2. **Gradual Temperature Adjustments**
   - Adjusts setpoint gradually (1-2¬∞C at a time)
   - Prevents aggressive cooling/heating cycles
   - Maintains steady-state operation

3. **Minimum Runtime Protection**
   - Ensures A/C runs for minimum time before mode changes
   - Prevents rapid cycling that wastes energy
   - Configurable runtime and off-time minimums

4. **Smart Pre-conditioning**
   - Only pre-cools/heats when necessary
   - Uses medium fan speeds for efficiency
   - Proximity-based activation

5. **Intelligent Away Mode**
   - Three options: Off, Eco, or Maintain
   - Eco mode keeps minimal climate control
   - Prevents extreme temperature swings

## Installation

1. **Copy Blueprint**: Place `ultimate_climate_control.yaml` in:
   ```
   config/blueprints/automation/
   ```

2. **Create Helper Entities** (REQUIRED - unique for each room):
   - Via UI: Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Helpers ‚Üí Create Helper
   - **Basic Helpers (Required)**:
     - Input Text: `input_text.climate_last_mode_living_room`
     - Input DateTime: `input_datetime.climate_last_change_living_room` (with date AND time)
   - **Smart Mode Helpers (Required for Smart Mode)**:
     - Input Select: `input_select.climate_control_mode_living_room` (Auto/Manual/Smart)
     - Input DateTime: `input_datetime.presence_last_detected_living_room` (presence tracking)
     - Input Boolean: `input_boolean.climate_proximity_override_living_room` (emergency override)
   - **Dynamic Adaptation Helpers (Optional)**:
     - Input Number: Temperature history, effectiveness scores
     - Input Text: Trend tracking
     - Input DateTime: Mode start times
   - Copy and rename for each room (bedroom, office, etc.)

3. **Setup Proximity Sensors**: Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   proximity:
     home:
       zone: home
       devices:
         - person.your_name  # Replace with your person entities
         - person.partner_name
       tolerance: 50
       unit_of_measurement: m
   ```
   This creates:
   - `sensor.home_nearest_distance` - Distance from home in meters

## Configuration Guide

### Essential Settings

#### Climate Entities
Select one or more A/C units to control. The blueprint will:
- Average temperatures across units
- Apply same settings to all units
- Coordinate operation for efficiency

#### Presence Configuration
- **People to Track**: Select person entities
- **Presence Devices**: Add PCs, TVs, or other indicators
- **Proximity Sensors**: Configure distance tracking

### 3-Tier Temperature Thresholds

#### Cooling Escalation (üå°Ô∏è NEW SYSTEM)
- **LOW Cooling** (e.g., 24.1¬∞C): Gentle cooling with minimal fan, maximum efficiency
- **MEDIUM Cooling** (e.g., 25.0¬∞C): Balanced cooling with medium fan speeds  
- **HIGH Cooling** (e.g., 26.0¬∞C): Maximum cooling with high fan, emergency mode
- **Comfort Zone** (20.0-24.0¬∞C): Eco mode or off

#### Heating Escalation (üî• COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED)
- **LOW Heating** (e.g., 19.9¬∞C): Gentle heating with minimal fan, maximum efficiency
- **MEDIUM Heating** (e.g., 19.0¬∞C): Balanced heating with medium fan speeds
- **HIGH Heating** (e.g., 18.0¬∞C): Maximum heating with high fan, emergency mode

> **Note**: All thresholds automatically adjust based on your target temperature and comfort zone settings. Advanced users can override individual thresholds.

### Power Efficiency Settings

#### Eco Mode (Recommended: ON)
Instead of turning off completely:
- Maintains temperature with minimal energy
- Prevents temperature swings
- Reduces startup cycles

#### Gradual Adjustment (Recommended: ON)
- Adjusts temperature in 1-2¬∞C increments
- Prevents aggressive operation
- Saves 15-20% energy

#### Runtime Protection
- **Minimum Runtime**: 10 minutes (prevents short cycling)
- **Minimum Off Time**: 5 minutes (protects compressor)

## Power Saving Recommendations

### Optimal Settings for Efficiency

1. **Temperature Ranges**
   - Cooling: Set to 24-26¬∞C (not lower)
   - Heating: Set to 20-22¬∞C (not higher)
   - Wider comfort zone = less operation

2. **Fan Speed Strategy**
   - Use AUTO when possible
   - High speed only for extreme temperatures
   - Eco mode with Level 1-2 for maintenance

3. **Away Mode**
   - Use "eco" instead of "off"
   - Prevents extreme temperature recovery
   - Saves 30-40% vs constant operation

4. **Pre-conditioning**
   - Enable only if commute is predictable
   - Set larger approaching distance (10km)
   - Uses less energy than rapid cooling/heating

### Energy Monitoring

The blueprint tracks:
- Runtime hours per day
- Cycling frequency
- Efficiency rating

Monitor these via:
- `sensor.climate_runtime_today`
- `sensor.climate_efficiency_rating`

## Example Configurations

### Single Room Setup
```yaml
Climate Entities: climate.bedroom_ac
People: person.john, person.jane
Comfort Zone: 22-24¬∞C
Eco Mode: Enabled
Gradual Adjustment: Enabled
```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging
1. **Turn on debug mode** in the blueprint settings
2. **View logs**: Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs
3. **Filter by**: `blueprints.climate_control`
4. **Look for**: üîç CLIMATE DEBUG messages

Debug logs show:
- Trigger events and reasons
- Current temperature and thresholds
- Decision logic (which mode activated)
- Why no action was taken
- All condition evaluations

### A/C Cycling Too Frequently
- Increase minimum runtime (15-20 min)
- Enable gradual adjustment
- Widen comfort zone
- Check debug logs for rapid mode changes
- Look for "runtime_lockout: ACTIVE" messages

### Not Cooling/Heating Fast Enough
- Check if temperature is within the 3-tier escalation ranges
- Verify debug logs show correct threshold conditions
- Look for "LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH conditions: True" messages
- Ensure fan speeds are configured for your A/C unit

### Understanding the New 3-Tier System (v2.8.21)
- **Debug logs show all 6 thresholds**: cooling_low, cooling_medium, cooling_high, heating_low, heating_medium, heating_high
- **"Choose block completed - no conditions matched"**: Temperature is in comfort zone (working correctly)
- **Threshold calculations**: Based on target temperature ¬± comfort zone ¬± aggressiveness
- **Fan speed selection**: Automatic based on A/C capabilities and intensity level

### High Energy Usage
- Enable eco mode
- Widen comfort zone
- Check away mode settings
- Review debug logs for cycling patterns

### Automation Not Triggering
1. Enable debug logging
2. Check "Last triggered" in automations list
3. Verify helper entities exist and are named correctly
4. Ensure someone is "home" in the system
5. Check temperature sensor is providing valid readings

## Advanced Features

### Custom Notification Services
Add multiple notification services:
```yaml
Notification Service: notify.mobile_app_phone
Additional Services:
  - notify.email
  - notify.telegram
```

### Integration with Energy Tariffs
Combine with utility rate sensors:
- Reduce operation during peak rates
- Pre-cool/heat during off-peak
- Use eco mode during expensive periods
