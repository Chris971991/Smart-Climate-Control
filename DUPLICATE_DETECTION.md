# 🛡️ Duplicate Detection & Conflict Prevention

## Overview

The Smart Climate Helper Creator includes **comprehensive duplicate detection** to prevent conflicts and ensure clean setups.

---

## 🔍 What Gets Checked

### 1. ✅ Room Name Duplication

**When:** During Step 1 (Room Name)

**How it works:**
- Uses unique_id based on sanitized room name
- Checks against all existing config entries
- Prevents setting up the same room twice

**User sees:**
```
❌ Climate control for this room already exists.
```

**Solution:** Use a different room name or delete the existing setup first.

---

### 2. ✅ Climate Entity Conflicts

**When:** During Step 3 (Climate Entities Selection)

**How it works:**
- Checks if selected A/C units are already controlled by another room
- Compares against all existing config entries
- Shows which room is using the conflicting A/C

**User sees:**
```
⚠️ One or more of these A/C units are already being controlled
by another room's automation.

Already in use by: Living Room

Please either:
• Select different A/C units
• Delete the conflicting room's setup first
• Use the same A/C for multiple rooms (not recommended)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Each A/C should only be controlled by ONE automation
- Multiple automations controlling the same A/C causes conflicts
- Prevents "fighting" between different room automations

**Example conflict:**
```
User 1: Sets up "Living Room" → uses climate.living_room_ac
User 2: Tries to set up "Office" → tries to use climate.living_room_ac
Result: ❌ Error shown, prevented!
```

---

### 3. ✅ Helper Entity Existence

**When:** During Step 5 (Before creating helpers)

**How it works:**
- Checks if helpers with the same entity IDs already exist
- Tests for `input_text.climate_last_mode_{room}` existence
- Prevents creating duplicate helpers

**User sees:**
```
❌ Failed to create climate control setup.

Helper entities for 'Living Room' already exist.
Please use a different room name or delete existing helpers first.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Each helper entity ID must be unique in HA
- Duplicate helpers cause entity ID conflicts
- Prevents overwriting existing helper data

**Example conflict:**
```
User: Tries to set up "Living Room" again
System: Detects input_text.climate_last_mode_living_room exists
Result: ❌ Error shown, prevented!
```

---

### 4. ✅ Automation ID Conflicts

**When:** During Step 5 (Before creating automation)

**How it works:**
- Reads existing `automations.yaml`
- Checks for automation ID `climate_control_{room}`
- Prevents duplicate automation IDs

**User sees:**
```
❌ Failed to create climate control setup.

Automation for 'Living Room' already exists.
Please delete the existing automation or use a different room name.
```

**Why this matters:**
- Automation IDs must be unique in HA
- Duplicate IDs cause automation conflicts
- Prevents overwriting existing automations

**Example conflict:**
```
User: Tries to set up "Living Room" again
System: Detects automation ID "climate_control_living_room" exists
Result: ❌ Error shown, prevented!
```

## 🎯 Multi-Layer Protection

The integration uses **4 layers of duplicate detection**:

```
Layer 1: Room Name Check (unique_id)
         ↓ PASS
Layer 2: Climate Entity Conflict Check
         ↓ PASS
Layer 3: Helper Existence Check
         ↓ PASS
Layer 4: Automation ID Check
         ↓ PASS

✅ ALL CLEAR - Create everything!
```

If **any layer fails** → User gets clear error message → Setup prevented

---

## 💡 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Accidentally Clicks "Add Integration" Twice

**What happens:**
1. First setup: Completes successfully ✅
2. Second setup: Enters same room name
3. **Layer 1 catches it:** "Climate control for this room already exists"
4. Setup aborted, no damage done! ✅

---

### Scenario 2: User Tries to Control Same A/C from Two Rooms

**What happens:**
1. Living Room setup: Uses `climate.living_room_ac` ✅
2. Office setup: Tries to use `climate.living_room_ac` again
3. **Layer 2 catches it:** "Already in use by: Living Room"
4. User must select different A/C or delete Living Room setup

---

### Scenario 3: User Manually Created Helpers with Same Names

**What happens:**
1. User manually created: `input_text.climate_last_mode_bedroom`
2. User runs wizard for "Bedroom"
3. **Layer 3 catches it:** "Helper entities for 'Bedroom' already exist"
4. User must delete manual helpers or use different room name

---

### Scenario 4: User Has Existing Automation with Same ID

**What happens:**
1. User has automation ID: `climate_control_kitchen` (from old manual setup)
2. User runs wizard for "Kitchen"
3. **Layer 4 catches it:** "Automation for 'Kitchen' already exists"
4. User must delete old automation first

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Room Name Check (Layer 1)
```python
# In async_step_user()
sanitized_name = sanitize_room_name(room_name)
await self.async_set_unique_id(f"climate_helpers_{sanitized_name}")
self._abort_if_unique_id_configured()
```

### Climate Entity Conflict Check (Layer 2)
```python
# In async_step_climate_entities()
conflicts = await self._check_climate_entity_conflicts(selected_entities)
if conflicts:
    errors["base"] = "climate_entities_in_use"
    errors["conflicting_rooms"] = ", ".join(conflicts)
```

### Helper Existence Check (Layer 3)
```python
# In _create_helpers()
test_helper_id = f"input_text.climate_last_mode_{sanitized_name}"
if await self._check_helper_exists(test_helper_id):
    raise ValueError(f"Helper entities for '{room_name}' already exist.")
```

### Automation ID Check (Layer 4)
```python
# In _create_automation()
automation_id = f"climate_control_{sanitized_name}"
existing_ids = [auto.get("id") for auto in automations]
if automation_id in existing_ids:
    raise ValueError(f"Automation for '{room_name}' already exists.")
```

## 🎓 Best Practices for Users

### DO:
✅ Use unique, descriptive room names
✅ Delete old setups before creating new ones
✅ Read error messages carefully - they explain the conflict
✅ Use one A/C per room automation

### DON'T:
❌ Try to set up the same room twice
❌ Control one A/C from multiple room automations
❌ Manually create helpers before running the wizard
❌ Ignore conflict errors and force through

---

## 🚨 What If User Ignores Warnings?

All checks are **enforced** - user cannot proceed if conflicts exist:

- **Room name duplicate:** Setup aborted immediately
- **Climate entity conflict:** Cannot move to next step
- **Helper exists:** Creation fails with error
- **Automation ID conflict:** Creation fails with error

**No way to bypass** = No corrupted configurations! 🛡️

---

## 🔄 Recovery from Conflicts

If user hits a conflict, here's how to resolve:

### For Room Name Conflicts:
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
2. Find existing "Smart Climate Helper Creator" entry
3. Click **Delete**
4. Run wizard again

### For Climate Entity Conflicts:
1. Decide which room should control the A/C
2. Delete the other room's setup (if needed)
3. Or select a different A/C unit

### For Helper Conflicts:
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers
2. Search for the conflicting helper (e.g., "climate_last_mode_bedroom")
3. Delete all helpers for that room
4. Run wizard again

### For Automation Conflicts:
1. Go to Settings → Automations & Scenes
2. Find the conflicting automation
3. Delete it
4. Run wizard again
