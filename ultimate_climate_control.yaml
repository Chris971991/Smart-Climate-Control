  name: Ultimate Smart Climate Control - v2.2.1
  description: >-
    📌 Version: 2.2.1
    
    
    🌡️ INTELLIGENT CLIMATE CONTROL with power-efficient operation, proximity-based 
    pre-conditioning, and presence detection. Control multiple A/C units with full 
    customization of temperatures, distances, and operating modes.
    
    💡 POWER SAVING MODE: Configured to turn OFF in comfort zone (saves 40-60% energy)
    with wider temperature tolerance (±2°C) and extended cycling protection.
    
    🔄 UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY: Auto-detects and adapts to different A/C models:
    • HVAC modes: auto ↔ heat_cool, supports all Daikin variants
    • Fan speeds: Level 5 ↔ 5, Auto ↔ auto, Quiet ↔ Silence  
    • Swing modes: Both ↔ both, Vertical ↔ vertical, 3D ↔ both
    
    🏠 SMART MODE PRESENCE: Room-specific climate control based on occupancy:
    • Room occupied: Normal temperature control
    • Room empty (timeout): Configurable eco/off/maintain behavior  
    • Away from house: Global away mode (separate setting)
    
    ✨ NEW IN v2.1:
    • Time-Based Scheduling - Different temperatures for different times (optional)
    • Window Detection - Auto-off when windows open (optional)
    • Weather Compensation - Adjust based on outdoor temperature (optional)
    • Hysteresis Logic - Prevents rapid on/off cycling
    • Fixed stability timer and check interval bugs
    
    ✨ NEW IN v2.2:
    • Adaptive Control Mode - Auto-switch modes based on room occupancy (optional)
    
    
    🧠 CONTROL MODES EXPLAINED:
    
    • AUTO MODE: Full automation with occupancy detection and presence-based control. 
      System automatically adjusts temperature when you're home or away.
    
    • MANUAL MODE: Full manual control with no automation. 
      You control temperature, fan speed, and on/off manually.
    
    • SMART MODE: Aggressive presence detection and advanced occupancy sensing. 
      Uses motion sensors, door sensors, phone presence, and predictive algorithms 
      to optimize temperature before occupancy and maintain comfort during use.
      🌡️ NEW: Temperature Stability Auto-Off - automatically turns off AC when 
      temperature equilibrium is reached (configurable tolerance & duration).
    
    
    ⚡ KEY FEATURES:
    
    • Smart Mode Control - Auto/Manual/Smart modes with presence timeout
    
    • Room-Specific Presence - BLE/PIR sensors for accurate occupancy
    
    • Proximity Zones - Different behaviors based on distance from home
    
    • Eco Mode - Reduces energy use by 30-40% vs on/off cycling
    
    • Smart Pre-conditioning - Activates when approaching home
    
    • Multi-Zone Support - Control 1 or many A/C units
    
    • Gradual Adjustments - Prevents aggressive cycling
    
    • Runtime Protection - Extends equipment life
    
    
    ⚠️ REQUIRED SETUP - Create unique helpers for EACH room/automation:
    
    
    1️⃣ Input Text Helper (unique per room):
    
    • Living Room: input_text.climate_last_mode_living_room
    
    • Bedroom: input_text.climate_last_mode_bedroom
    
    • Office: input_text.climate_last_mode_office
    
    • Icon: mdi:air-conditioner
    
    
    2️⃣ Input DateTime Helper (unique per room):
    
    • Living Room: input_datetime.climate_last_change_living_room
    
    • Bedroom: input_datetime.climate_last_change_bedroom  
    
    • Office: input_datetime.climate_last_change_office
    
    • Has date: ✅ Yes
    
    • Has time: ✅ Yes
    
    • Icon: mdi:clock-outline
    
    
    🧠 SMART MODE HELPERS (for advanced control):
    
    • input_select.climate_control_mode_[room] (Auto/Manual/Smart modes)
    
    • input_datetime.presence_last_detected_[room] (presence timeout tracking)
    
    • input_boolean.climate_proximity_override_[room] (emergency override)
    
    
    🧠 DYNAMIC ADAPTATION HELPERS (for smart escalation):
    
    • input_number.climate_temp_history_[room] (temperature tracking)
    
    • input_text.climate_trend_direction_[room] (rising/falling/stable)
    
    • input_datetime.climate_mode_start_time_[room] (when current mode started)
    
    • input_number.climate_effectiveness_score_[room] (0-100, how well it's working)
    
    
    🔧 STABILITY & HYSTERESIS HELPERS (for v2.1+ features):
    
    • input_datetime.temp_stable_since_[room] (tracks when temp became stable)
    
    • input_text.climate_last_transition_[room] (for hysteresis tracking)
    
    
    📍 Create via: Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper
    
    
    3️⃣ PROXIMITY SENSORS - Set up via Integration:
    
    1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations
    2. Click "+ ADD INTEGRATION" 
    3. Search for and select "Proximity"
    4. Configure:
       • Name: "Home"
       • Zone: Select your "Home" zone
       • Devices: Select your person entities
       • Tolerance: 50m (prevents GPS jitter updates)
    
    This creates:
    • sensor.home_nearest_distance (distance in meters)
    • sensor.home_nearest_direction_of_travel (towards/away/stationary/arrived)
    
    
    📊 Optional Energy Tracking:
    
    • input_number.climate_power_saving_score (efficiency %)
    
    • sensor.climate_runtime_today (daily runtime tracking)
    
    • sensor.climate_efficiency_rating (efficiency score)
