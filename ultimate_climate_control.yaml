    ## ✨ Key Features

    **🎮 3 Control Modes:**
    - **Auto:** House-wide automation with home/away detection
    - **Smart:** Room-specific presence with BLE/PIR/mmWave sensors (immediate shutoff when leaving)
    - **Manual:** Full user control with emergency temperature overrides only

    **🧠 Intelligent Automation:**
    - Room-specific presence detection (BLE, motion, door sensors, adjacent room support)
    - Dynamic 5-level fan escalation based on actual effectiveness (Level 1→5)
    - Temperature stability auto-off (prevents wasted runtime)
    - Proximity pre-conditioning (cools/heats before you arrive home)
    - Near-target stall detection (pushes through final degrees)

    **⚡ Energy Efficiency:**
    - 40-60% energy savings vs always-on operation
    - Smart hysteresis prevents short-cycling and equipment wear
    - Graduated temperature tiers (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH with escalation)
    - Eco mode for unoccupied rooms (off/eco/maintain options)
    - Comfort zone idle (no unnecessary cooling/heating)

    **🔧 Advanced Capabilities:**
    - Universal A/C compatibility (auto-detects HVAC modes, fan speeds, swing modes)
    - Multi-zone support (control 1 or multiple units simultaneously)
    - Weather compensation (adjusts thresholds based on outdoor temperature)
    - Time-based scheduling (morning/day/evening/night + weekends)
    - Window detection with auto-shutoff
    - Manual override protection (respects user changes for 3+ hours)

    ## 🆕 Latest Update - v3.1.3

    **🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Smart Mode Grace Period Activation Bug v3.1.3**
    - 🐛 FIXED: Grace period no longer activates from momentary sensor blips
    - 🛡️ ENHANCED: Confirmation delay now properly prevents false activations
    - ⚡ BEHAVIOR: Grace period requires prior CONFIRMED presence (not random motion detection)
    - 🎯 IMPACT: Stops AC from turning on when nobody is actually in the room

    **What Changed:**
    - **Before:** 1-second motion sensor blip → 10-minute grace period → AC turns on with no presence
    - **After:** Grace period ONLY activates after confirmed sustained presence (>= confirmation delay)
    - **Your Settings:** 15-min confirmation + 10-min grace = Proper protection against false triggers

    **📝 Previous Updates:**
    - v3.1.2: 🐛 Extended stall detection distance requirement (1.5°C)
    - v3.1.0: 🚀 Dynamic target adjustment feature

            External temperature sensor for **more accurate room temperature readings**.

            If not configured, the system will use your A/C unit's built-in sensor.

            **Best practices for external sensors:**

            • Place at seated height (1-1.5m from floor)
            • Position away from direct sunlight and heat sources
            • Central location in the room for representative readings
            • Avoid drafty areas or corners

            **Benefit:** External sensors provide significantly better temperature control accuracy.

          name: ⚡ Response Aggressiveness
          description: |
            **Controls how quickly the AC reaches maximum power** when temperature goes outside comfort zone.

            **What this actually does:**
            - Higher values = AC ramps to HIGH/MAX cooling faster = reaches target temp quicker
            - Lower values = AC escalates gradually through LOW→MEDIUM→HIGH = more efficient but slower

            **Settings explained:**

            • **1 = Gentle** - AC won't hit maximum power until 3°C past comfort zone
              └─ Most efficient, but AC may run for hours on low power

            • **2 = Smooth** (Default) - Medium power at comfort edge, high at +1°C, max at +2°C
              └─ Balanced approach for most situations

            • **3 = Balanced** - Maximum power kicks in at 2°C past comfort zone
              └─ Good balance between speed and efficiency

            • **5 = Aggressive** - Maximum power immediately at 1°C past comfort zone
              └─ Fastest response, reaches target quickly, uses more power

            **Real Example** (Target: 23°C, Comfort Zone: ±2°C = 21-25°C):

            **With Aggressiveness = 2 (Default):**
            - 21-25°C → AC OFF (in comfort zone)
            - 25.1°C → LOW cooling starts
            - 26°C → MEDIUM cooling (+1°C past edge)
            - 27°C → HIGH cooling (+2°C past edge)

            **With Aggressiveness = 5 (Aggressive):**
            - 21-25°C → AC OFF (in comfort zone)
            - 25.1°C → LOW cooling starts
            - 26°C → HIGH cooling already! (+1°C triggers max power)

            **💡 Choose based on your priority:**
            - AC running too long trying to reach target? → Increase to 3-5
            - Want maximum efficiency and don't mind slower response? → Use 1-2

            **How multiple presence sensors work together** to detect room occupancy:

            • **ANY (Default):** Trigger if ANY sensor detects presence (most responsive)
            • **ALL:** Require ALL sensors to detect presence (most accurate, may miss presence)
            • **SMART:** Require BLE + Motion when both exist, otherwise ANY (balanced)
            • **BEDROOM:** Adaptive mode for bedrooms - intelligently handles sleep detection (⭐ NEW!)
            • **MAJORITY:** Require majority of sensors to agree (3+ sensors recommended)
            • **BLE_PLUS:** Require BLE + at least one other sensor (prevents false BLE triggers)

            **🛏️ BEDROOM Mode Details:**
            Intelligently adapts to whatever sensors you have - perfect for bedrooms with bed sensors!

            **With BLE + Motion + Bed Sensor:**
            • Awake & moving: BLE + Motion = ✅
            • Sleeping in bed: BLE + Bed Sensor = ✅
            • Phone left behind: BLE only = ❌ (prevents false positives)

            **With Motion + Bed Sensor (no BLE):**
            • Either Motion OR Bed = ✅ (detects awake OR sleeping)

            **With BLE + Bed Sensor (no motion):**
            • Requires BLE + Bed = ✅ (ensures you're actually in bed)

            **With only BLE or Motion:**
            • Falls back to single sensor (works without bed sensor)

            **Recommendations:**
            • **Bedrooms with bed sensor:** Use BEDROOM mode (best sleep detection)
            • **Single sensor:** Use ANY mode
            • **BLE + PIR (living areas):** Use SMART or BLE_PLUS mode
            • **Multiple PIR:** Use MAJORITY mode for best accuracy
            • **High accuracy needed:** Use ALL mode but may miss brief presence

            **Note:** SMART mode requires both BLE AND motion when both exist. BEDROOM mode is more flexible.

          description: |
            **For open-plan spaces**, specify adjacent room names that should also trigger this AC.
            
            **Use case:** Your Living Room AC covers an open Kitchen/Living/Dining area, but BLE 
            sensors report specific room names. This allows the AC to activate when you're detected
            in ANY of these connected spaces.
            
            **⚠️ CRITICAL: Check Your BLE Sensor Format First!**
            Before configuring, check **Developer Tools → States** to see exactly how your BLE sensor reports room names:
            
            • **If sensor shows:** `living room` → **Enter:** `Living Room`

            • **If sensor shows:** `living_room` (with underscores) → **Enter:** `living_room`

            • **If sensor shows:** `livingroom` → **Enter:** `livingroom`
            
            **Format must match exactly** (case-insensitive but spaces/underscores matter).
            
            **Examples based on your BLE sensor format:**
            • **Spaces format:** Kitchen, Dining Room, Living Room
            • **Underscore format:** kitchen, dining_room, living_room
            • **No spaces format:** kitchen, diningroom, livingroom
            
            **Example Configuration (assuming spaces format):**
            • **Room Name:** Living Room (main room from top of config)
            • **Adjacent Rooms:** Kitchen, Dining Room, Family Room
            • **Result:** AC activates when BLE detects Living Room, Kitchen, Dining Room, OR Family Room
            
            **⚠️ IMPORTANT for SMART/BLE_PLUS modes:**
            When using validation modes that require motion + BLE, you MUST also add the motion 
            sensors from adjacent rooms to the "Room Presence Sensors" list above.
            
            **Example for SMART mode (spaces format):**
            • **Adjacent Room Names:** Kitchen, Family Room  (match BLE sensor format)
            • **Room Presence Sensors must include:**
              - `sensor.phone_ble_area` (BLE sensor)

              - `binary_sensor.living_room_motion` (main room)

              - `binary_sensor.kitchen_motion` (adjacent room motion)

            **Minimum acceptable temperature change rate** (°C per minute) before triggering escalation.

            **How it works:**
            • System calculates: (current_temp - previous_temp) / time_elapsed
            • If rate is below this threshold for the "Stall Escalation Time" → escalates power
            • Customizable for your AC's capabilities and room characteristics

            **Rate examples:**
            • **0.10-0.20°C/min:** Very aggressive (gaming rooms, high-power ACs)
            • **0.05-0.10°C/min:** Aggressive (fast AC, small room, tight control)
            • **0.02-0.05°C/min:** Responsive (fast AC, good insulation)
            • **0.01-0.02°C/min:** Average AC, medium room (recommended)
            • **0.005-0.01°C/min:** Slow AC, large room, patient control
            • **0.001-0.005°C/min:** Very slow AC or poorly insulated room

            **Example scenarios:**
            • **Very Aggressive:** 0.15°C/min = expects 9°C drop per hour (gaming rooms)
            • **Aggressive:** 0.08°C/min = expects 4.8°C drop per hour
            • **Balanced:** 0.01°C/min = expects 0.6°C drop per hour (recommended)
            • **Patient:** 0.005°C/min = expects 0.3°C drop per hour

            **How it works:**
            • **Near-Target Stall:** Escalates if distance ≤ this value AND stalled for 15+ min
            • **Time-Based Stall:** Escalates if distance > half this value AND poor progress for configured time

            **Tolerance levels:**
            • **0.5-1.0°C:** Aggressive response (tight control, escalates early)
            • **1.0-2.0°C:** Balanced approach (recommended - default 1.0°C)
            • **2.0-3.0°C:** Patient response (allows more drift before escalating)

            **Example (1.0°C setting):**
            • If 0.9°C from target and stalled → Gentle escalation (Level 1)
            • If 0.6°C from target and poor progress → Strong escalation (Level 3)

            **How many times the stall time** before triggering maximum escalation (Level 4/Fan 5).

            **How it works:**
            When AC has been running with poor progress for `stall_escalation_time × multiplier`,
            escalation jumps to Level 4 (emergency/maximum power).

            **Examples with stall_escalation_time = 2 minutes:**
            • **10x:** Emergency after 20 minutes stuck → Very aggressive
            • **20x:** Emergency after 40 minutes stuck → Aggressive (recommended)
            • **30x:** Emergency after 60 minutes stuck → Balanced
            • **50x:** Emergency after 100 minutes stuck → Patient
            • **100x:** Emergency after 200 minutes stuck → Very patient

            **User scenario (20x multiplier, 2min stall time):**
            ```
            Time 0: AC starts cooling, 25°C → 22°C target
            Time 2: Still 25°C, slow progress → Level 3 (time-based stall)
            Time 10: Still 24.8°C, poor progress → Level 3 (waiting)
            Time 40: Still 24.5°C after 40 min → Level 4! (emergency)
            Result: Maximum fan power after extended stalling
            ```

            **When to use lower values (aggressive):**
            • Gaming rooms with high, variable heat loads
            • Rooms that need fast temperature correction
            • Poor insulation or external heat sources
            • Testing/debugging escalation behavior

            **When to use higher values (patient):**
            • Bedrooms (avoid sudden fan noise increases)
            • Well-insulated rooms with stable temps
            • Efficient AC units that eventually catch up
            • Rooms where you rarely need maximum power

            **Recommendation:** Start with 20x-30x, adjust based on how long your AC typically takes to reach target.

          description: |
            **SMART ESCALATION BOOST:** Automatically adjust AC target temperature when escalation is active to help struggling AC reach your desired temperature faster.

            **How it works:**
            - **Cooling mode:** Lowers AC target below your desired temp (e.g., 24°C → 21°C at Level 3)
            - **Heating mode:** Raises AC target above your desired temp (e.g., 22°C → 25°C at Level 3)
            - **Creates buffer zone:** Prevents temp from immediately drifting back
            - **Auto-reverts:** Returns to normal target once temperature stable

            **Why this helps:**
            - AC compressor works harder with more aggressive target
            - Combined with higher fan speed = maximum effectiveness
            - Faster cooling/heating when system detects struggle
            - Prevents getting stuck near target without reaching it

            **Example (cooling with 1.0°C offset):**
            - Level 0: Target 24°C (normal)
            - Level 1: Target 23°C (slightly lower)
            - Level 2: Target 22°C (more aggressive)
            - Level 3: Target 21°C (very aggressive)
            - Level 4: Target 20°C (maximum)

            **Recommended:** Enable for rooms where AC struggles to reach target. Disable for oversized AC units or if you want precise temperature control only.

            **The offset multiplies by escalation level:**
            - **0.5°C/level:** Gentle adjustment (Level 4 = ±2°C from desired)
            - **1.0°C/level:** Balanced (Level 4 = ±4°C from desired) ← **Recommended**
            - **1.5°C/level:** Aggressive (Level 4 = ±6°C from desired)
            - **2.0°C/level:** Very aggressive (Level 4 = ±8°C from desired)

            **Examples with 1.0°C offset:**

            **Cooling (desired: 24°C):**
            - Level 1: 24°C - 1°C = 23°C
            - Level 2: 24°C - 2°C = 22°C
            - Level 3: 24°C - 3°C = 21°C
            - Level 4: 24°C - 4°C = 20°C

            **Heating (desired: 22°C):**
            - Level 1: 22°C + 1°C = 23°C
            - Level 2: 22°C + 2°C = 24°C
            - Level 3: 22°C + 3°C = 25°C
            - Level 4: 22°C + 4°C = 26°C

            **Safety limits:** System will never adjust beyond 10°C (cooling) or 35°C (heating) regardless of offset.

          name: Enable Wrong-Direction Escalation
          description: |
            **Incrementally escalate power when temperature moves the wrong way.**

            **How it works:**
            • Checks temperature trend at every effectiveness check (e.g., every 2 minutes)
            • **Cooling mode:** If temperature RISING → add escalation levels
            • **Heating mode:** If temperature FALLING → add escalation levels
            • Adds levels incrementally until temperature stabilizes or reaches maximum

            **Example (with +1 per check, checking every 2 minutes):**
            ```
            Time 0: 25.6°C → Fan 1 (Base Level 0)
            Time 2: 25.7°C rising → Fan 2 (Level 0+1)
            Time 4: 25.8°C rising → Fan 3 (Level 0+2)
            Time 6: 25.9°C rising → Fan 4 (Level 0+3)
            Time 8: 25.9°C stable → Stay Fan 4 (stops escalating)
            ```

            **When useful:**
            • Gaming rooms with variable heat load (PCs, consoles)
            • Rooms with external heat sources (sun, appliances, cooking)
            • Fast response to unexpected temperature changes
            • High-occupancy rooms with variable people count

            **Safe to disable if:**
            • Your room has stable temperature patterns
            • You prefer slower, more conservative escalation
            • Testing/debugging automation behavior

            **Advantages over time-based boost:**
            • Responds immediately at first effectiveness check
            • Smooth, gradual escalation instead of sudden jumps
            • Self-correcting (stops when temp stabilizes)
            • Simpler to configure and understand

            **Safety:** Disabled by default. Won't affect existing automations.
          default: false

          name: Wrong-Direction Escalation Per Check
          description: |
            **How many escalation levels to add per effectiveness check when temperature moves wrong direction.**

            • **0:** Disabled (ignore wrong direction, even if feature enabled)
            • **+1:** Gentle incremental response (⭐ recommended for most rooms)
            • **+2:** Aggressive incremental response (for extreme heat loads)

            **How it works:**
            At each effectiveness check (e.g., every 2 minutes), if temperature is moving
            the wrong direction, this many levels are added to escalation.

            **Example with +1 per check:**
            ```
            Check 1: Base L0, rising → L0+1 = Fan 2
            Check 2: Base L0, rising → L0+2 = Fan 3
            Check 3: Base L0, rising → L0+3 = Fan 4
            Check 4: Base L0, rising → L0+4 = Fan 5 (maximum)
            Result: Smooth escalation over 6-8 minutes
            ```

            **Example with +2 per check (aggressive):**
            ```
            Check 1: Base L0, rising → L0+2 = Fan 3
            Check 2: Base L0, rising → L0+4 = Fan 5 (maximum)
            Result: Reaches maximum in 4 minutes
            ```

            **Recommendation:**
            • **Gaming rooms:** +1 (balanced, reaches max in 8 min)
            • **Extreme heat loads:** +2 (aggressive, reaches max in 4 min)
            • **Stable rooms:** 0 or disable feature entirely

            **Examples:**

            • **0.10°C/min:** Conservative (6°C/hour) - only triggers on strong trends

            **Recommendation:**
            • **Most rooms:** 0.05°C/min (balanced sensitivity)
            • **Noisy sensors:** 0.08-0.10°C/min (reduce false triggers)

            • **Shorter delays (1-3 min):** Quickly switch from Manual to Auto/Smart when you enter
            • **Longer delays (5-10 min):** Avoid switching too soon if you manually changed the mode

                • Mode: Cooling

                • Final Escalation: Level {{ final_escalation_level }} (base + wrong_dir_add, capped at 4)

            💡 How Incremental Escalation Works:
                {% if not wrong_direction_enabled %}
                • Feature DISABLED - using base escalation only
                {% elif wrong_direction_per_check == 0 %}
                • Feature enabled but set to +0 - no escalation added
                {% elif not wrong_direction_detected %}
                • Temperature trending correctly - no additional escalation needed
                {% else %}
                • Wrong direction detected! Adding +{{ wrong_direction_per_check }} level(s) this check
                • At next effectiveness check (in ~{{ effectiveness_check_mins }} min), if still wrong direction: +{{ wrong_direction_per_check }} more
                • Escalation builds up: Check 1: +{{ wrong_direction_per_check }}, Check 2: +{{ wrong_direction_per_check * 2 }}, Check 3: +{{ wrong_direction_per_check * 3 }}, etc.
                • Stops escalating when temp stabilizes or reaches Level 4 (Fan 5 maximum)

            🎯 {{ room_name | upper }} DEBUG: Dynamic Target Adjustment

            🔧 Smart Escalation Boost Active:
            • Feature Enabled: {{ enable_dynamic_target }}
            • User Desired Temperature: {{ target_temp }}°C
            • Final Escalation Level: {{ final_escalation_level }}
            • Offset Per Level: {{ escalation_offset }}°C
            • Total Adjustment: {{ (final_escalation_level * escalation_offset) | round(1) }}°C

            🌡️ Target Calculation:
                • Current Mode: {{ last_mode }}
                {% if last_mode in ['cooling_low', 'cooling_medium', 'cooling_high'] %}
                • Cooling Mode: LOWERING target to make AC work harder
                • Formula: {{ target_temp }}°C - ({{ final_escalation_level }} × {{ escalation_offset }}°C) = {{ adjusted_target }}°C
                • AC will cool to {{ adjusted_target }}°C instead of {{ target_temp }}°C
                • Creates {{ (target_temp - adjusted_target) | round(1) }}°C buffer zone below user target
                {% elif last_mode in ['heating_low', 'heating_medium', 'heating_high'] %}
                • Heating Mode: RAISING target to make AC work harder
                • Formula: {{ target_temp }}°C + ({{ final_escalation_level }} × {{ escalation_offset }}°C) = {{ adjusted_target }}°C
                • AC will heat to {{ adjusted_target }}°C instead of {{ target_temp }}°C
                • Creates {{ (adjusted_target - target_temp) | round(1) }}°C buffer zone above user target
                {% endif %}

            💡 Why This Helps:
                • AC compressor works harder with more aggressive target
                • Combined with Fan Level {{ final_escalation_level }} = maximum effectiveness
                • Buffer zone prevents immediate drift back when escalation reduces
                • Auto-reverts to {{ target_temp }}°C once temperature stable

            ⚙️ Behavior:
                • Target sent to AC: {{ adjusted_target }}°C ({{ "%.1f" | format(adjusted_target - target_temp) }}°C {% if adjusted_target > target_temp %}above{% else %}below{% endif %} user target)
                • Once stable and escalation drops to 0: Returns to {{ target_temp }}°C
