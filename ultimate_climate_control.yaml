  name: Ultimate Smart Climate Control - v2.3.1

  description: >-
    📌 Version: 2.3.1
    
    
    🌡️ INTELLIGENT CLIMATE CONTROL: 
    
    Power-efficient operation, proximity-based 
    pre-conditioning, and presence detection. Control multiple A/C units with full 
    customization of temperatures, distances, and operating modes.
    
    💡 POWER SAVING MODE:
    
    Configured to turn OFF in comfort zone (saves 40-60% energy)
    with wider temperature tolerance (±2°C) and extended cycling protection.
    
    🔄 UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY:
    
    Auto-detects and adapts to different A/C models:

    • HVAC modes: auto ↔ heat_cool, supports all Daikin variants
    • Fan speeds: Level 5 ↔ 5, Auto ↔ auto, Quiet ↔ Silence  
    • Swing modes: Both ↔ both, Vertical ↔ vertical, 3D ↔ both
    
    🏠 SMART MODE PRESENCE:
    
    Room-specific climate control based on occupancy:

    • Room occupied: Normal temperature control
    • Room empty (timeout): Configurable eco/off/maintain behavior  
    • Away from house: Global away mode (separate setting)
    
    ✨ NEW IN v2.1:

    • Time-Based Scheduling - Different temperatures for different times (optional)

    • Window Detection - Auto-off when windows open (optional)

    • Weather Compensation - Adjust based on outdoor temperature (optional)

    • Hysteresis Logic - Prevents rapid on/off cycling

    • Fixed stability timer and check interval bugs
    
    ✨ NEW IN v2.2:
    • Adaptive Control Mode - Auto-switch modes based on room occupancy (optional)
    
    ✨ NEW IN v2.3:
    • Manual Override Protection - Respects user manual changes for configurable time
    
    
    🧠 CONTROL MODES EXPLAINED:
    
    • AUTO MODE: 
    
      Full automation with occupancy detection and presence-based control. 
        System automatically adjusts temperature when you're home or away.
    
    • MANUAL MODE:
    
      Full manual control with no automation. 
        You control temperature, fan speed, and on/off manually.
    
    • SMART MODE: 
    
    Aggressive presence detection and advanced occupancy sensing. 

      Uses motion sensors, door sensors, phone presence, and predictive algorithms 
      to optimize temperature before occupancy and maintain comfort during use.

      🌡️ NEW: Temperature Stability Auto-Off - automatically turns off AC when 
      temperature equilibrium is reached (configurable tolerance & duration).
    
    
    ⚡ KEY FEATURES:
    
    • Smart Mode Control - Auto/Manual/Smart modes with presence timeout
    
    • Room-Specific Presence - BLE/PIR sensors for accurate occupancy
    
    • Proximity Zones - Different behaviors based on distance from home
    
    • Eco Mode - Reduces energy use by 30-40% vs on/off cycling
    
    • Smart Pre-conditioning - Activates when approaching home
    
    • Multi-Zone Support - Control 1 or many A/C units
    
    • Gradual Adjustments - Prevents aggressive cycling
    
    • Runtime Protection - Extends equipment life

            If not configured, the system will use your A/C unit's built-in sensor.
            
            Best practices for external sensors:
            
            • Place at seated height (1-1.5m from floor)
            • Position away from direct sunlight and heat sources
            • Central location in the room for representative readings
            • Avoid drafty areas or corners
            
            External sensors provide significantly better temperature control accuracy.

            • OFF: Use temperature from the first A/C unit only
            
            Turn OFF when using a single external sensor for all units to avoid conflicts.
